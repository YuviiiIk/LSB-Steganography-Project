# LSB Image Steganography

This repository contains a Python implementation of **Least Significant Bit (LSB) Steganography**, a technique used to hide secret messages within digital images.

## Overview

Steganography is the art and science of hiding communication. LSB steganography works by embedding the bits of a secret message into the least significant bits of the pixel values of an image. Since these changes are in the least significant bits, they are imperceptible to the human eye, making the presence of the hidden message difficult to detect.

This project provides functions to:

  * **Encode**: Hide a text message within an image.
  * **Decode**: Extract a hidden text message from an encoded image.

## How It Works

The core idea behind LSB steganography is to modify the very last bit (the least significant bit) of each color channel (Red, Green, Blue) of each pixel in an image.

  * **Encoding**: For each character in the secret message, its 8-bit binary representation is taken. Each of these bits is then used to replace the LSB of consecutive color channels in the image pixels. A special delimiter (`####END_MESSAGE####`) is appended to the message to indicate its end during decoding.

  * **Decoding**: The LSB of each color channel of each pixel in the encoded image is extracted. These extracted bits are then concatenated to form a binary string. This binary string is converted back into characters until the predefined message delimiter is encountered, revealing the hidden message.

## Features

  * **Simple and Effective**: Implements a straightforward LSB embedding technique.
  * **Text Hiding**: Capable of hiding plain text messages.
  * **Error Handling**: Includes basic error handling for file operations and message capacity.
  * **Message Delimiter**: Uses a unique delimiter to ensure accurate message extraction.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

  * Python 3.x
  * Pillow library (`PIL`)

You can install Pillow using pip:

```bash
pip install Pillow
```

### Usage

1.  **Clone the repository (or download the Python script):**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Place your cover image:**
    Make sure the image you want to use for steganography (e.g., `image1.jpg`) is in the same directory as the Python script.

3.  **Run the script:**
    The provided `main` block in the script demonstrates how to encode and decode a message.

    ```python
    # Example Usage in the script (at the bottom)
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        input_image_name = "image1.jpg" # Make sure this image exists in the same directory
        secret_message_to_hide = "Hello! This is a top secret message hidden using LSB steganography. This is a test to see how well it works!"

        # Encode the message
        encoded_output_image_name = "lsb_encoded_image.png"
        encode_image(input_image_name, secret_message_to_hide, encoded_output_image_name)

        # Decode the message
        extracted_message = decode_image(encoded_output_image_name)

        if extracted_message is not None:
            print(f"\nExtracted message: '{extracted_message}'")
            if extracted_message == secret_message_to_hide:
                print("\nVerification: The extracted message matches the original! Steganography successful.")
            else:
                print("\nVerification: Mismatch between original and extracted message. Something went wrong.")
        else:
            print("\nDecoding failed or no message was extracted.")
    ```

    You can run the script from your terminal:

    ```bash
    python your_steganography_script_name.py
    ```

### Functions

  * `text_to_binary(text)`: Converts a string to its binary representation.
  * `binary_to_text(binary_string)`: Converts a binary string back to text.
  * `encode_image(image_path, secret_message, output_path="encoded_image.png")`: Hides `secret_message` in the image at `image_path` and saves the result to `output_path`.
  * `decode_image(encoded_image_path)`: Extracts and returns the hidden message from the image at `encoded_image_path`.

## Limitations

  * **Capacity**: The amount of data that can be hidden depends directly on the image size. Larger images can hold more data.
  * **Image Format**: Saving the encoded image to a **lossy format** like JPEG after encoding will likely destroy the hidden message, as lossy compression algorithms discard "insignificant" data, which includes the LSBs. Always save to a **lossless format** like PNG.
  * **Security**: LSB steganography is relatively simple and can be detected by sophisticated analysis techniques. It's not suitable for high-security applications without further encryption or advanced methods.
